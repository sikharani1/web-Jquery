5)I have used Proxy.php file on the server.I have also tried to make the interface user friendly and tried to keep it simple and sober as a professional website at the same time impressive. I also thought about the idea to add a YouTube video of our department so that the prospective students can anytime watch the video and get a live experience. I tested my website thoroughly for null values if at all returned by the API in some sections. I have tried not to make the website redundant and used different types of interfaces. I also solved the problem of JQuery version conflict and have used plugins with different versions as well. I have also added code for browser compatibility check in the html file.
